## Welcome to lessthantwentychars' scripting portfolio
This website has been set up on github by me, lessthantwentychars, to display my scripting ability in a portfolio. This is typically used for when people want to hire me for their projects or even when making a game.

### Portfolio/Scripts
##### You came to see my scripts, right? Here they are:

```markdown
- Case Spinner: a small sample of a case spinner that I worked on not too long ago.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lessthantwentychars/scripting/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
