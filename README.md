## Welcome to lessthantwentychars' scripting portfolio

This website has been set up on github by me (lessthantwentychars) to showcase my scripts. This is typically used for when people want to hire me for their projects or even when making a game.

### Portfolio/Scripts

**You came to see the scripts, right? Here they are:**
